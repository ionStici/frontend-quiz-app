# Frontend Quiz App

This is a solution to the [Frontend quiz app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/frontend-quiz-app-BE7xkzXQnU). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## About the Project

The **"Frontend Quiz App"** is an educational tool designed to enhance users' knowledge in various frontend technologies.

_Initially constructed with Next.js 14 Pages Router_, this project has been transitioned to a _Client-Side Rendered (CSR) application using React and Vite_.

This project was part of my learning journey with React and Next.js, so some coding decisions reflect an amateur approach, showcasing the evolution of my skills over time.
